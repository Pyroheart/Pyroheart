### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on little JS games in my free time, and even tho I do use and wish to learn even more other programming langugages I have more interest in JavaScript at the moment.

And I'm also looking for an apprenticeship.

Feel free to check any file from this GitHub, and to try out the games if you find any interesting ones !
